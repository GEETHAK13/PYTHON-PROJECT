TRAFFIC LIGHT SIMULATION:
 
It contains a 4-way traffic intersection with traffic signals controlling the flow of traffic in each direction. 
Each signal has a timer on top of it which shows the time remaining for the signal to switch from green to yellow, yellow to red, or red to green. 
Vehicles such as cars, bikes, buses, and trucks are generated, and their movement is controlled according to the signals and the vehicles around them. 
This simulation can be further used for data analysis or to visualize AI or ML applications.
